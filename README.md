- Applied unsupervised learning approaches (GMM) to identify a small set of genes that show significant
differential expression across single-cells induced by therapeutic treatment on Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
cells.
- Performed Principal Component Analysis to the dataset and found a set of genes that highly correlated with
anticancer effects that caused by metformin (antidiabetic drug).
